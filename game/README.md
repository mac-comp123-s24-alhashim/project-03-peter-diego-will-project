**Title:** 
Tic-Tac-Toe Game vs. Computer

**Team Members:**  
Diego Kozma, Will Kochel, Peter Simpson

**Team Name:** 
Big Boys

_____

**Description:**

We want to build a game where the user can input Tic-Tac-Toe moves to play against a computer, which will 
**ideally** respond with the most optimal move. The goal is for the bot to play to a draw every time, assuming optimal
moves are inputted from the user. The tic-tac-toe board, Xs, and Os will be represented with turtle drawings.
_____

**Why did we choose this project?**

We wanted to create something that a user can interact with, that also shows that we can code something fairly complex
in combination with turtle graphics.

_____

**Inspiration behind the project:**

The inspiration behind this project is that our group members like tic-tac-toe because it's a game that's impossible
to lose if you know the correct strategies for the game. As a result, we want to frustrate the user because they 
cannot beat our bot, unless they find some inaccuracy in its code.
_____

**Implementation/Responsibility Plan:**

Our plan is to, for the first checkpoint, have a two-player version of the game ready to go using a game board made of
text, such as | and __ for the hashtag game board. For the second checkpoint, we're aiming to have a version of the bot 
ready to go, minus graphics. For the last step, we'll add the turtle graphics in and make it all look pretty, along with
some bug testing.
